# Deploy NCPA including disk and ZFS pool monitoring

Deploy Nagios NCPA package to an x86_64 host along with scripts useful to monitor disk drive and ZFS pool health and perform necessary configuration tasks.

Configuration of the hosts on the Nagios server is not included.

## Status

Set aside for now.

* Raspberry Pi releases no longer being produced (because the good folk at Nagios do not have a Pi to build on.)
* Try to build on a Pi running the current version of 32 bit R-Pi OS. The build wants to pull in some Python2.7 stuff. I don't like that so I'm looking at other monitoring solutions.
